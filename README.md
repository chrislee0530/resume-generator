# RESUME Generator

## Project Description

For my UBC CPSC 210 term project, which will be my first project ever built in Java, I propose designing a **resume generator**. Nowadays, a professional, concise, and well-structured resume is essential for every undergraduate student–whether their post-graduate goal is employment at one of FAANG companies or further education at graduate school.  Recently, I learned the essential components of resume. A resume must “summarize your professional work experience, skills, and educational history in a one one or two-page document” (Indeed, 2024). Unfortunately, many people overlook these significant components, which can lead to missed opportunities in securing a job or admission to graduate programs. My project aims to address this issue.

The users will get to enter their information in response to specific prompts. At the end of the process, the program will compile all inputted information and generate a professional resume. Although this user-friendly program can be utilized by individuals of any age, its primary targeted user segment consists of undergraduate students and recent graduates who need a professional resume for their post-graduate journey. This program is especially meaningful to me as an undergraduate student, as I understand the importance of having a strong resume. With this project, I wish to help others (including myself) reduce the stress and time spent manually formatting resumes, allowing them to focus on other valuable things.
